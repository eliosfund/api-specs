      description: |-
        Retrieves all action items associated with your partner account.

        **Business Context:**
        Action items represent tasks, issues, or documentation requirements that need
        attention during the solar installation process. They help track project progress,
        ensure compliance, and maintain quality standards.

        **Action Item Types:**
        - **Documentation**: Required documents, permits, or certificates
        - **Quality Assurance**: Inspection items or compliance checks
        - **Customer Communication**: Follow-ups, confirmations, or notifications
        - **Technical**: Engineering reviews, design approvals, or system testing
        - **Financial**: Payment processing, rebate applications, or funding requirements

        **Use Cases:**
        - Project management and milestone tracking
        - Quality assurance and compliance monitoring
        - Team coordination and task assignment
        - Customer communication management
        - Audit trail and project documentation

        **Response Information:**
        - Action item details (title, description, priority, status)
        - Assignment information (project, team member)
        - Due dates and completion tracking
        - Related attachments and comments
        - Creation and update timestamps

        **Filtering and Organization:**
        Action items are automatically filtered by your partner account access.
        Results include items from all projects and applications you have permission to view.

        **Status Management:**
        - `open`: Newly created, requires attention
        - `in_review`: Under review or being processed
        - `needs_corrections`: Requires updates or fixes
        - `hold`: Temporarily paused or waiting for dependencies
        - `complete`: Successfully finished

        **Priority Levels:**
        - `critical`: Immediate attention required, blocks project progress
        - `high`: Important, should be addressed soon
        - `medium`: Standard priority, normal workflow
        - `low`: Nice to have, can be addressed when time permits

        Removes a specific adder from a project permanently.

        **Business Context:**
        Use this endpoint to remove adders that are no longer needed, were added
        in error, or when project scope changes eliminate the need for specific
        upgrades or equipment.

        **Common Deletion Scenarios:**
        - **Scope Reduction**: Customer decides against certain upgrades
        - **Budget Constraints**: Removing optional items to meet budget
        - **Engineering Changes**: Alternative solutions eliminate need for adder
        - **Permit Issues**: Items that cannot be approved by local authorities
        - **Data Cleanup**: Removing duplicate or erroneous entries

        **Important Considerations:**
        - **Permanent Action**: Deletion cannot be undone
        - **Project Impact**: Removal may affect total project cost and financing
        - **Dependencies**: Check for related items or dependencies before deletion
        - **Approval Requirements**: Some deletions may require customer or manager approval

        **Business Rules:**
        - Cannot delete adders from finalized or completed projects
        - Deletion may trigger project total recalculation
        - Associated attachments and comments may also be removed
        - Audit logs will maintain record of deletion for compliance

        **Alternative Actions:**
        - Consider updating quantity to 0 instead of deletion for audit trail
        - Use project status changes to temporarily exclude adders

      summary: Get ACH authorization status and options
      description: |
        Retrieves the ACH (Automated Clearing House) authorization status and available
        completion methods for an approved qualification application.

        **Business Context:**
        ACH authorization is required for customers to set up automatic payments for their
        solar financing. This step comes after successful credit qualification.

        **Prerequisites:**
        - Application must have `approved` status from qualification
        - Customer must be ready to authorize bank account access

        **Authorization Methods:**

        1. **API Integration (Recommended):** Use the returned `plaidLinkToken` to initialize
           Plaid Link in your application for seamless bank account connection

        2. **Web Redirect:** Forward the customer to `achAuthorizationUrl` for a hosted
           authorization experience

        **Response Fields:**
        - `achAuthorizationStatus`: `complete` or `incomplete`
        - `plaidLinkToken`: Token for Plaid Link initialization (expires in 30 minutes)
        - `achAuthorizationUrl`: Direct link for web-based authorization
        - `achAuthorizationConsentHtml/Markdown`: Legal consent text to display

        **Next Steps:**
        After ACH authorization is complete, the customer can proceed to project creation
        and contract execution.

        Creates a new external identifier for the application or updates an existing one
        if the key already exists.

        **Business Context:**
        This endpoint supports integration workflows by allowing partners to establish
        and maintain cross-references between their systems and Elios Fund applications.

        **Update Behavior:**
        - If an external identifier with the same key exists, it will be updated
        - If the key is new, a new external identifier will be created
        - This allows for idempotent operations and easy data synchronization

        **Common Integration Patterns:**
        - Store your CRM opportunity/lead ID when creating applications
        - Link to third-party project management and workflow systems
        - Connect customer portal and tracking system references
        - Maintain audit trails across multiple systems
        - Support multi-platform data synchronization

        **Security:**
        - Requires `update:applications` scope
        - External identifiers are scoped to your partner account
        - Values should not contain sensitive customer information

        Initiates the credit qualification process for a submitted application.

        **Business Context:**
        This endpoint triggers the automated credit assessment that determines if the
        customer qualifies for solar financing and at what tier level.

        **Prerequisites:**
        - Application must be in `submitted` status
        - Cannot run qualification on applications that are already qualified
        - All required applicant information must be complete and validated

        **Qualification Process:**
        1. Credit bureau reports are pulled for all applicants
        2. Automated underwriting rules are applied
        3. Credit tier is assigned based on qualification results
        4. Final approval or decline decision is made

        **Status Transitions:**
        - `submitted` → `in_progress` (immediately)
        - `in_progress` → `approved` or `declined` (within 1-3 minutes)
        - Some applications may go to `onhold` for manual review

        **Credit Tiers (best to worst):**
        - `diamond`: Excellent credit, best rates
        - `platinum`: Very good credit
        - `gold`: Good credit
        - `silver`: Fair credit
        - `bronze`: Below average credit
        - `mercury`: Poor credit, limited options
        - `declined`: Does not qualify for financing

        **Monitoring Results:**
        - **Recommended**: Subscribe to `application.approved` and `application.declined` webhooks
        - **Alternative**: Poll the GET `/applications/{applicationId}` endpoint every 30 seconds
        - Results typically available within 60 seconds

      summary: Create a new solar system design
      description: |-
        Creates a new solar system design for a project with specifications and performance data.

        **Business Context:**
        Solar designs define the technical specifications and performance characteristics
        of the proposed solar installation, including system size, equipment selection,
        and energy production estimates.

        **Design Creation Process:**
        1. **Layout Planning**: System size and equipment configuration
        2. **Performance Modeling**: Energy production and shading analysis
        3. **Equipment Selection**: Modules, inverters, racking, and storage
        4. **Optimization**: Balancing cost, performance, and aesthetics

        **Required Design Data:**
        - **System Size**: Total DC capacity in kilowatts
        - **Performance Metrics**: Annual production and system offset
        - **Shading Analysis**: Annual Solar Access (ASA) percentage
        - **Design Identity**: Name and source system

        **Primary Design Logic:**
        - If `isPrimary=true`: Sets this as the active design (others become secondary)
        - If `isPrimary=false/null` and no primary exists: Becomes primary automatically
        - If `isPrimary=false/null` and primary exists: Becomes secondary design

        **Integration Sources:**
        - **Manual Entry**: Basic system specifications
        - **Design Software**: Aurora Solar, Helioscope, PV*SOL
        - **Site Analysis**: Scanifly, Sunobi integration
        - **API Import**: External design tools and platforms

        **Validation Requirements:**
        - System size must be realistic for project type
        - Production estimates should align with system size and location
        - ASA values must be within reasonable ranges (0-100%)
        - System offset should match customer energy needs

        **Common Use Cases:**
        - Initial system sizing and layout
        - Design import from engineering software
        - Alternative design scenarios
        - System optimization iterations
        - Customer presentation materials

      summary: Update a solar system design
      description: |-
        Updates specific fields of an existing solar system design.

        **Business Context:**
        Design updates are common throughout the project lifecycle as systems
        are refined through engineering review, customer feedback, equipment
        availability, and performance optimization.

        **What Can Be Updated:**

        **Design Specifications:**
        - System size and performance metrics
        - Annual production and offset calculations

    delete:
      summary: Delete a solar system design
      description: |-
        Permanently removes a specific solar system design from a project.

        **Business Context:**
        Use this endpoint to delete designs that are no longer needed, were created
        in error, or when project requirements have changed to eliminate specific
        design versions.

        **Common Deletion Scenarios:**
        - **Design Iterations**: Removing outdated or superseded design versions
        - **Error Correction**: Deleting designs created with incorrect data
        - **Project Changes**: Removing designs that no longer meet requirements
        - **Storage Management**: Cleaning up unused or duplicate designs
        - **Workflow Cleanup**: Removing draft designs that won't be developed

        **Important Considerations:**
        - **Permanent Action**: Design deletion cannot be undone
        - **Primary Design Protection**: Cannot delete the primary/active design
        - **Project Impact**: Deletion may affect project documentation and history
        - **Dependencies**: Check for related attachments or references before deletion
        - **Approval Requirements**: Some deletions may require manager approval

        **Business Rules:**
        - Cannot delete primary designs (must promote another design to primary first)
        - Cannot delete designs from finalized or completed projects
        - Associated external identifiers and metadata are also removed
        - Audit logs maintain record of deletion for compliance

        **Alternative Actions:**
        - Consider updating design status instead of deletion for audit trail
        - Use design versioning to track evolution rather than deleting old versions
        - Mark designs as inactive rather than permanent deletion

        Creates a new external identifier for the design or updates an existing one
        if the key already exists.

        **Business Context:**
        This endpoint supports integration workflows by allowing partners to establish
        and maintain cross-references between their systems and Elios Fund designs.

        **Update Behavior:**
        - If an external identifier with the same key exists, it will be updated
        - If the key is new, a new external identifier will be created
        - This allows for idempotent operations and easy data synchronization

        **Common Integration Patterns:**
        - Store your CRM project/design ID when creating designs
        - Link to third-party design tools and their project references
        - Connect workflow management system task IDs
        - Maintain audit trails across multiple systems

        Creates a new design segment (solar array) within an existing design. A design segment represents a grouping of solar modules configured with specific parameters such as azimuth, tilt, and shading characteristics.

        **Business Context:** Design segments are used to define different arrays within a single solar installation. Each segment can have different orientations, tilt angles, and shading conditions, allowing for accurate modeling of complex roof structures and optimized energy production calculations.

        **Important:** The associated design's project must be in "NEW" status to create segments. Projects in progress require creating a new primary design to update specifications.

        - **Performance Monitoring**: Baseline for system performance tracking
        - **Utility Applications**: Submitted for interconnection approvals

        **Primary Design Rules:**
        - Only one design per project can be primary at any time
        - If no primary design exists, returns 404
        - Primary status is automatically managed when designs are created/updated
        - Primary design changes may trigger financial recalculations

        **When Primary Design Changes:**
        - New design created with `isPrimary=true`
        - Existing design updated with `isPrimary=true`
        - Previous primary automatically becomes secondary

    patch:
      summary: Update a webhook configuration
      description: |-
        Updates specific fields of an existing webhook configuration.

        **Business Context:**
        Use this endpoint to modify webhook settings such as endpoint URLs, event subscriptions,
        security configurations, or enable/disable status without requiring webhook recreation.

        **What Can Be Updated:**

        **Endpoint Configuration:**
        - Target URL and HTTP method
        - Description and documentation
        - Enable/disable status

        **Event Subscriptions:**
        - Add or remove event types
        - Modify event filtering
        - Update subscription scope

        **Security Settings:**
        - Webhook secret for signature validation
        - SSL certificate configuration (CA, client certs)
        - Authentication headers and tokens

        **Operational Settings:**
        - Enable or disable webhook delivery
        - Retry configuration and timeouts
        - Rate limiting parameters

        **Business Rules:**
        - URL changes take effect immediately for new events
        - Event subscription changes apply to future events only
        - Disabled webhooks stop receiving all events
        - Security changes require webhook endpoint updates

        **Common Use Cases:**
        - Updating webhook URLs during infrastructure changes
        - Adding or removing event subscriptions
        - Enabling/disabling webhooks for maintenance
        - Updating security secrets during key rotation
        - Modifying descriptions for better documentation

        **Impact Assessment:**
        - **URL Changes**: Test new endpoint before updating
        - **Event Changes**: Review downstream systems for compatibility
        - **Security Updates**: Coordinate with webhook endpoint maintainers
        - **Status Changes**: Monitor integration health after changes

        **Best Practices:**
        - **Gradual Updates**: Test changes in development first
        - **Monitoring**: Watch delivery metrics after configuration changes
        - **Documentation**: Update integration documentation after changes
        - **Backup**: Record previous configuration before major updates
        - **Coordination**: Notify webhook endpoint owners of changes

    delete:
      summary: Delete a webhook
      description: |-
        Permanently removes a webhook from the system, stopping all future event notifications.

        **Business Context:**
        Webhook deletion is typically performed when integrations are being
        decommissioned, endpoints are no longer valid, or webhook configurations
        need to be completely rebuilt.

        **Deletion Impact:**
        - **Immediate Effect**: Webhook stops receiving events immediately
        - **Permanent Action**: Cannot be undone - webhook must be recreated if needed
        - **Event History**: Past webhook deliveries remain in logs for audit purposes
        - **No Notifications**: No events will be sent to the deleted webhook URL

        **When to Delete Webhooks:**
        - **Integration Decommission**: Removing old or unused integrations
        - **Endpoint Changes**: When webhook URLs are permanently changing
        - **Security Incidents**: Compromised endpoints requiring immediate removal
        - **Configuration Errors**: Starting over with clean webhook setup
        - **Partner Offboarding**: Removing webhooks for departed partners

        **Alternative Actions:**
        - **Disable Instead**: Use PATCH to set `enabled: false` for temporary suspension
        - **Update Configuration**: Use PATCH to modify URL, events, or settings
        - **Event Filtering**: Modify event subscriptions without deletion

        **Best Practices:**
        - **Backup Configuration**: Record webhook settings before deletion
        - **Gradual Migration**: Disable before deleting when migrating endpoints
        - **Monitor Impact**: Verify downstream systems handle the removal properly
        - **Documentation**: Update integration documentation after deletion

        **Common Use Cases:**
        - Cleaning up test or development webhooks
        - Removing webhooks for decommissioned services
        - Resolving webhook delivery failures permanently
        - Consolidating multiple webhooks into single endpoints
        - Partner relationship termination cleanup

        **Integration Cleanup:**
        After deletion, ensure downstream systems are updated to remove
        dependencies on webhook notifications from this endpoint.
